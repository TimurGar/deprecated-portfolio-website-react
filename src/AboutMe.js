            Hello World! <br></br>
            I am Timur, an aspiring software engineer passionate about volunteering and using tech for positive change. 
            I am a big fan of self-education, which is how I learned Web/Mobile Development and Robotics. 
            I am currently interested in Machine learning, and Cybersecurity. In my free time, I like to play pool with friends and build radio-controlled planes.
